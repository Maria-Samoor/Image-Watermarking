# Image Watermarking 
## Overview
This Git repository provides a Python code implementation for adding a text and a binary watermark to an image using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), High-Frequency Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Low-Frequency DCT. The code includes print statements for tracing and understanding the watermarking process.
## Dependencies
The code relies on the following Python libraries:

numpy: Used for numerical operations on arrays.

opencv-python: Used for image loading and manipulation.

## Notes
The code includes print statements for tracing and understanding the watermarking process. You can modify or remove these statements based on your needs.

The code provided in this repository is meant for educational purposes and may not be optimized for performance or security.

It is recommended to review and validate the implementation before using it in any production environment.
